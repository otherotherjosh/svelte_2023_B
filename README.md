## Inspiration Sites
<a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/">![Kinetic Games](./docs/inspiration-kineticgames.JPG)</a>
_Official website of the people behind the original game_

I chose this website because I just had to try and see if the game already had a website about it. And as it turns out, it's pretty nifty.

I really like that the images have an animated film grain texture overlayed on top:
it makes them feel alive and it reminds me of playing the game (a similar filter is present during gameplay as well).
I am going to steal this concept.

I also like the hero section. Something about having an image (or video) take up most of the viewport really satisfies me.

Their hero sections are wider than the aforementioned Kinetic Games Website. Some say _cinematic_, but I still prefer the IMAX-esque style of hero sections that fill more of the screen)

<a href="https://www.spiritbox.com/">![Spiritbox](./docs/inspiration-spiritbox.JPG)</a>
_Website of the band Spiritbox_

I picked their site because I ran out of ideas for places to look. Spiritbox happens to share the name of an item in the game, so if I _really_ have to thematically link it to my website, that's how.

It's fairly simple by design but I enjoy the level of whitespace and the absolute refusal to stray away from the purple color scheme.
